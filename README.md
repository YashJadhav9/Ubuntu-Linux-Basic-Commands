I have been self-learning Ubuntu Linux and practicing basic commands in a VirtualBox environment. This repository documents the fundamental Linux commands I have learned and used for system navigation, file management, and networking.

How I Practiced These Commands
	1.	Installed Ubuntu Linux in VirtualBox.
	2.	Practiced basic terminal commands to navigate the filesystem.
	3.	Used networking commands to check system connectivity.
	4.	Explored file management by creating, moving, and deleting files.
	5.	Monitored system processes and resource usage.
